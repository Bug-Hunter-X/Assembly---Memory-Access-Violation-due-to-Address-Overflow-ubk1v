mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx*4`.  However, if `ecx` is a very large number, the result of this calculation could overflow, leading to an unexpected memory address being accessed.  If the program attempts to read from or write to an invalid or protected memory location due to this overflow, it will result in a crash or unpredictable behavior.  The problem is subtle because it only manifests under specific circumstances where `ecx` exceeds the limits of addressable memory.
